# Linux 2.6 kernels and PDF files
#
# Some institutions using Linux 2.6 kernels have encountered problems accessing Ovid PDF files. These problems occur with any attempt to access the PDF files, whether directly from a browser on the Linux server or through EZproxy. The conflict appears to be a bug in the packet inspection performed by iptables, as disabling iptables resolves the issue, yet reactivating iptables with even a simple rule to allow all traffic to pass recreates the issue. This problem appears to have a hardware component, as institutions have reported the problem manifesting on certain hardware configurations, but not others.
#
# If you suspect this issue, start by issuing the Linux command:
#
#     uname -r
#
# which will display your kernel version, which will look similar to "2.6.9-67.0.15.EL". In this example, 2 is the version of the kernel, 6 is the major revision, and 9 is the minor revision.
#
# Linux 2.6 kernels at minor revision 21 (2.6.21) and above are reported to have this issue resolved.
#
# If your institution is using Linux and encountering this behavior, you can verify the issue by launching a browser on the EZproxy server and trying to access a PDF document directly. If this fails, you can disable iptables and retest.
#
# Since this issue exists in the operating system, there are no changes to EZproxy that can correct this issue.
